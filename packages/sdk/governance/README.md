# @celo/governance

Governance depends on @celo/contractkit and @celo/explorer.

It provides functions to read and interact with Celo Governance Proposals (CGPs).

Construct Celo Governance Proposals using either the `InteractiveProposalBuilder` class (for CLI apps) or `ProposalBuilder` (consumable via JS)
