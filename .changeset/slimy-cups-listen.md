Add deprecation notice about future removal of `account:offchain-read` and `account:offchain-write` commands. These were created to showcase ["CIP8: Expand Metadata to general off-chain storage"](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/8260b49b2ec9a87ded6727fec7d9104586eb0752/CIPs/cip-0008.md), which has been abandond and they are presenting a high maintainence burden.
