# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving Celo SDK(s) and CLI(s).

If you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, you can create a 
[new discussion](https://github.com/celo-org/developer-tooling/discussions).

There are multiple opportunities to contribute. It doesn't matter if you are just
getting started or are an expert. We appreciate your interest in contributing.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Please ask before starting work on any significant new features.
> 
> It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing time and effort 
> into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we invite contributors to create a 
> [new discussion](https://github.com/wevm/viem/discussions) to discuss API changes or 
> significant new ideas.
